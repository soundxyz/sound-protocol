## Specification

See [spec](./spec.md) for current protocol specification. For details on how to build and run a custom minter instance, see section ["Adding a custom minter module"](./spec.md#adding-a-custom-minter-module) section in spec. Documentation coming soon.

## Architecture

The Sound Protocol comprises of several components: 

- **`SoundEdition`**  

  The NFT contract.

  An [ERC721A](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A) contract deployed via the [minimal proxy clone](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167) pattern.

  The `mint` function allows authorized minter contracts or administrators to batch mint NFTs  
  (authorization is granted via the `MINTER_ROLE` or `ADMIN_ROLE`).

- **`SoundCreator`** 

  A factory that allows for a single transaction setup that:
  1. Deploys and initializes `SoundEdition`.
  2. Authorize one or more `MinterContract`s on `SoundEdition`.   
  3. Configure one or more `MinterContract`s to mint on `SoundEdition`. 

- **`MinterContract`**

  A contract to call the `mint` function on `SoundEdition`.  
  This contract can implement any kind of customized sales logic.  
  One or more `MinterContract`s can be used on the `SoundEdition` simultaneously.

- **`fundingRecipient`**

  Can be a contract such as a [0xSplits](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts) wallet, or an Externally Owned Account (EOA).

- **`MetadataContract`**

  A contract which is called by the `SoundEdition` in the `tokenURI` function for customizable metadata logic.  
  Optional.

## Contracts

The smart contracts are stored under the `contracts` directory.

Files marked with an asterik (\*) are specific to [sound.xyz](https://sound.xyz),  
but you can refer to them if you are building contracts to interact with them on-chain,   
or building your own customized versions.

## Documentation

A comprehensive documentation is currently in the works.  

Please refer to the Natspec comments and [spec](./spec.md) for now for further details.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - You need to have `pnpm` installed globally, you can run `npm i -g pnpm` to install it.
-   [brew](https://brew.sh/)
-   [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) - You can run `sh ./setup.sh` to install Foundry and its dependencies.

### Setup

-   Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:soundxyz/sound-protocol.git
    cd sound-protocol
    ```

-   Setup node version
    Either install the version specified in `nvmrc` or use `nvm` to set it up:

    ```
    nvm use
    ```

-   Install packages

    ```
    pnpm install
    ```

-   Build contracts

    ```
    pnpm build
    ```

-   Run tests

    ```
    pnpm test
    ```

-   Print gas reports from tests

    ```
    pnpm test:gas
    ```

### Testing

(`v` == logs verbosity)

`forge test -vvv`

**Code coverage:**

We use [codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/soundxyz/sound-protocol/) for analysing the code coverage reports generated by forge coverage. To view code coverage locally, you'll need to install `lcov` (mac: `brew install lcov`) and run:

```
pnpm test:coverage
```

This will produce the coverage report in `/coverage` folder. Note that `forge coverage` is still in active development so it often claims if/else branches are uncovered even when there are tests executed on them.

### Deploying

Create a .env in the root with:

```
GOERLI_RPC_URL=
MAINNET_RPC_URL=
PRIVATE_KEY=
ETHERSCAN_KEY=
OWNER=<address that will own the ownable contracts>
```

Then run:

```
pnpm deploy:goerli
```

## Bug Bounty

Up to 10 ETH for any critical bugs that could result in loss of funds. Rewards will be given for smaller bugs or ideas.
